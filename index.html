<h2>Personal infomation</h2>
<p id="name"><b>Ariyan Aghdassi info:</b></p>

<p id="info"> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT.
    My interest in IT definitely started with gaming when I first played Tekken 3 on a PlayStation One, ever since then I bought every PlayStation and even eventually expanded to other platforms such as Nintendo and PC. I was introduced to gaming by my brother who owned the PlayStation One at the time, he also showed me how to use a lot of technological devices such as cameras and phones. However, since building the PC that I mentioned before, my interest in IT really expanded and felt quite an accomplishment after. I started moving towards IT over surveying as I enjoyed the aspects of IT much more. While surveying deals with technology and programs such as AutoCAD, it is very hands on compared to jobs in IT.
    After taking the Myers-Briggs test and receiving the personality type commander, I have learnt quite a lot about myself. According to the test most of my personality is very even, most shockingly that I am more extraverted than introverted. This is very different to what I thought as I believe I am quite a shy person, however after seeing this result, my social life makes more sense.
