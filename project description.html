<h2>LOST AND FOUND </h2>
<p><b>PART I, BRAINSTORMING AND PLANNING</b></p>
<br>
<p>
Aims (A general overview of the project during its initial planning stage)

At first, we wanted to make something that was easy to develop within the time span of three or so weeks (approx.), so we pitched our ideas within the group to see what could be done. The first thing we collectively thought of was a Roblox game.
<br><br>

The reasons why we chose Roblox as a means of making our game are as follows:
Roblox studio is free, provided by Roblox itself for users to make games that could be uploaded onto the Roblox platform to be played by the wide public.
The resources and models for certain things (i.e. buildings, maze wall, mobs, objects and such) can be found on the internet, again for free.
When stuck, there are a lot of tutorials on Youtube, the same cannot be said for other types of programming platforms.
Our game developer already has experience in making a Roblox game, which is mostly why we went through with the idea.
<br><br>

Although we did change our mind a couple of times, we ultimately decided to go through with the Roblox game idea.

<br><br>


Other options that we considered were:
Making a Minecraft mod that added a new boss mob, something along the lines of a giant zombie that could summon other miniature zombies and strikes of lightning, using the inactive “Giant” mob base that can be found in the game, this idea was considered due to the lack of Boss mobs inside the game (there are only three major bosses within the game; the Ender dragon, Guardian boss, and the Wither.) The “Giant” was chosen because although it can be found within the game’s files, it does not spawn naturally, which would make the production of the boss a lot easier since it already exists.


<br><br>
Adding a Capybara into Minecraft, for no other reason other than it being adorable, a cute passive mob that could be ride-able similar to a pig or horse, but we dropped this idea because we figured that someone probably already has made something like this. A capybara mob was also considered, something similar to the evil jack rabbit in Minecraft.

























Still on the same “Minecraft” boat, we also considered creating a sort of texture pack, one that turned the Villagers into Squid wards (yes like the one from Spongebob Squarepants), and the Wolves into the Boston terrier from Jojo’s Bizzare Adventure, this idea was dropped in the end because we thought it was much too simple for an end-of-semester assignment.

Creating a VRchat (Virtual reality chat)/Vtuber (Virtual Youtuber) model, a character model which was fully rigged from scratch, with a voice changer and all. We almost chose this idea because there has been a recent boom in the popularity of anything Virtual model related (i.e.; famous Vtuber “Gawr Gura”). Unfortunately, we did not end up choosing this idea because no one had any experience with Virtual model rigging, and most of the good tools needed for making it were behind a paywall (paid). Another reason we did not choose this for our assignment was because we figured that making a game would be a lot easier. (We even considered making a Mascot girl for RMIT with this)



This is how Virtual model rigging works typically, it’s painstakingly time-consuming.



A knock-off flappy bird game, basically a game that’s almost exactly like “flappy bird” except with a… worse quality, we didn’t go through with this idea due to legality issues and also figured that we needed something that was a little bit more creative.


A raspberry Pi for a type of baby monitor that lights up when a baby cries, quite helpful for parents albeit quite common already. This idea was scrapped because this was a lot more programming heavy, with tools that are quite expensive compared to something like a Java developer kit or Roblox studio, but also because we figured that if we chose something like this, we wouldn’t have much to write for our report.


One last idea that was mentioned but wasn’t really given a second thought was making a Golfing map for “Golf it!”, similar to the Minecraft texture pack, this idea was scrapped because it seemed far too simple.

One idea that was my personal favorite is probably making a Minecraft map of RMIT, a map that was a 1:1 scale. The problem was that, no one knew the ins-and-outs of RMIT very well, and the process of making it would be painstakingly slow and time-consuming, and we were pressed for time.


After choosing our preferred media of making our game project, we had to brainstorm and plan what kind of game we wanted to make, and what things we wanted within our game.

These are the things we decided and why:

First of all, we had to decide on a genre, one that was easy and fast to make, and after a thorough discussion we settled on the horror genre, a genre that is becoming quite common on the Roblox platform.

Now deciding the genre was easy, deciding what to put inside our game… Not so much, we wanted it to be spooky and incorporate some sort of puzzle and boss fight, but at the same time, we wanted it to be fun and engaging.

We also decided to look at other Roblox horror games for inspiration, one of them being https://www.roblox.com/games/338521019/Identity-Fraud-Revamp.


We took some time to choose a name for our game, because the name ultimately decides what the game outcome would be like, we had several options - few were handpicked from the internet and others created by James and I)

Here were the contestants for the names, and the reasons why we did or did not end up choosing them:

Whisper’s lullaby: Sounds like an extra creepy game idea, unfortunately we felt like we could not live up to the name’s standards. This name was probably my personal favorite though

Dark Space: Was almost considered because it sounded suitable with the game concept that we had in mind but there was already a popular game named Dark space on the internet.

Night Watch: Was an incredible name, but unfortunately did not align with the concept for the game we had in mind.

No Signal: Similar to “Dark space”, it was nearly considered as our main choice but it unfortunately got voted off during the team voting session.

Lost and Found: The winner of the team voting session, and the official name of our Horror Roblox game! Mostly chosen because the name won by a landslide (4-1 votes)

<br><br><br>
Roles (Our roles within the group)

Following our final decisions of what the game would be like, we still had to decide the roles within our group for this project. Here are our roles, not in any particular order:
<br>
James - Main game developer and concept creator<br>
Mitchell - Web developer for the team but helped in the game creation<br>
Isaac - Web developer for the team<br>
Klarisa - Documentation and design<br>
Ariyan - Presentation and editing<br>
Neil - Helped around in the game and web development.<br>

None of the roles are fully fixed and everyone helps out little by little here and there, but the amount of total contribution shall be seen on the contribution form. This concludes part 1 of the report.
